A set of scripts to visualize header inclusion trees.


Quickstart
----------

Install perl, graphviz, and kghostview.

Configure your linux kernel and 'make prepare'.

Adjust the Gather::Linux line near top of graph.pl.  Only
tested on x86_64 so far.

./graph.pl
  - do_it (this takes 30-120 seconds)
  - save_it

./graph.pl
  - load_it (this takes about 10 seconds)
  - x "linux/types.h"
  - x "linux/list.h"
  - x "linux/sched.h"
  - x "fs/dcache.c"



Concepts
--------

tsize
  transitive size, a measure of how many header files are included
  from a given top-level root file.

unique tsize
  The number of different files included from a given root file.

total tsize
  The number of files included from a given root file, if include
  guards were not used.  this number is useful when evaluating header
  file partitioning schemes which involve splitting up a header file.
  Doing that will tend to slightly increase the unique tsize while
  drastically lowering the total tsize.


   
Description
-----------

Nodes in the graph repesent files, edges represent inclusions.


Node Shapes:

  The house-shaped pentagon is the root of the inclusion tree.

  Solid circles are normal inclusion targets.

  Diamonds and solid octagons are popular inclusion targets whose
  incoming edges have been snipped to relax the graph.

  Dashed circles are the snipped edges which originally pointed
  to a diamond.

  Dashed octagons are the snipped edges which originally pointed
  to an octagon.

  Dashed nodes are also referred to as the "ghosts" of diamonds and
  octagons.


Node Colors:

  Blue represents the "primary inclusion hierarchy".  In other words,
  the inclusion hierarchy formed by the files with large unique tsizes.
  This inclusion chain almost always remains contiguous and is rarely
  snipped.

  Yellow represents a popular inclusion target with small unique tsize.

  Red represents a popular inclusion target with a large unique tsize.

  Dark grey represents normal header files.

  The more saturated a red or blue colored object is, the large the
  unique tsize.


Node Labels:

  Unsnipped nodes have the file name with the unique and total tsizes in
  round braces.

  Snipped nodes also include the number of incoming edges (the number of
  times the file was included) in diamond braces.
