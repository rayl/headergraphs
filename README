A set of scripts to visualize header inclusion trees.


Quickstart
----------

Install perl, graphviz, and kghostview.

Configure your linux kernel and 'make prepare'.

Adjust the Gather::Linux line near top of graph.pl.  Only
tested on x86_64 so far.

mkdir tmp

./graph.pl
  - do_it (this takes 30-120 seconds)
  - save_it

./graph.pl
  - load_it (this takes about 10 seconds)
  - x "linux/types.h"
  - x "linux/list.h"
  - x "linux/sched.h"
  - x "fs/dcache.c"



Concepts
--------

tsize
  transitive size, a measure of how many header files are included
  from a given top-level root file.

unique tsize
  The number of different files included from a given root file.

total tsize
  The number of files included from a given root file, if include
  guards were not used.  this number is useful when evaluating header
  file partitioning schemes which involve splitting up a header file.
  Doing that will tend to slightly increase the unique tsize while
  drastically lowering the total tsize.

backbone
  A contiguous subgraph starting from the root and composed of the
  nodes with "large" unique tsizes, for some arbitrary value of large.  
  Any child nodes below this size are considered "regular headers"
  and are not considered to be part of the backbone. "large" is
  currently hardcoded to a value useful for the Linux kernel headers.

 
Description
-----------

Nodes in the graph repesent files, edges represent inclusions.  To help
relax the graph and clean up the layout, some child edges may be
snipped.  The node shapes and labels indicate where and when this
has occurred.


Node Shapes:

  The house-shaped pentagon is the root of the inclusion tree.

  Ellipses are normal header files.

  Boxes are header files which have had one or more links to child
  nodes snipped in order to relax the graph.


Node Colors:

  Orange represents the root node of the graph.

  Blue represents the "primary inclusion hierarchy".  In other words,
  the inclusion hierarchy formed by the files with large unique tsizes.
  This inclusion chain almost always remains contiguous and is rarely
  snipped.

  Yellow represents a popular inclusion target with small unique tsize.

  Red represents a popular inclusion target with a large unique tsize.

  Pale green represents normal header files.

  The more saturated a red, yellow or blue colored object is, the large
  the unique tsize.


Node Labels:

  All nodes are labelled with the file name. The unique and total
  tsizes are placed underneath the name and separated by a dash.

  Nodes which have had some incoming edges snipped have a third number
  indicating the total number of parents for that file, including any
  incoming edges that weren't actually snipped.

  Nodes with outgoing edges snipped also include a list of the children
  who have been detached.  The information for each child (name, unique
  tsize, total tsize, and parent count) is placed on a single line per
  child.
